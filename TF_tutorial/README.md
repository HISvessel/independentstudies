This directory is a miniature tutorial to machine learning, the way of the future programming for my personal career and personal projects. We will utilize TensorFlow, a lightweigt and user friendly approach to machine learning interface, which will also be the biggest player in my future big project. 

It is good to understand a couple of things: What is machine learning? How can machines learn? What are the types of way in which a machine can learn based on input and output?
All of that and more, later on in this read me.
