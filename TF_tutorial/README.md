This directory is a miniature tutorial to machine learning, the way of the future programming for my personal career and personal projects. We will utilize TensorFlow, a lightweigt and user friendly approach to machine learning interface, which will also be the biggest player in my future big project. 

It is good to understand a couple of things: What is machine learning? How can machines learn? What are the types of way in which a machine can learn based on input and output?
All of that and more, later on in this read me.

Machine Learning
    It is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data by processing said data into its developing models and algorithms program or system. 

    Three ML categories exist:
        1. Supervised Learning - trains models on labeled data to predict or classify new unseen data.

        2. Unsupervised learning - finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data, like clustering or dimensionality reduction.

        3. Reinforcement Learning - learns though trial and error to maximize rewards, ideal fro decision making tasks.
    Additional types of ML categories:
        1. self supervised learning: it is often considered as a subset of unsupervised learning, where it generates its own labels from the data recieved without any manual labeling. Currently, it has become its own field, such as LLMs.

        2. semi supervised learning - this approach combines a small amount of labeled data along with large amounts of unlabeled data.
