This project repository was opened for the pupose of documenting my experience of creating a project with the XR Meshmap workshop

AR(augmented reality) - technology to simluate reality through the lens of glasses. FOr this workshop, we will bed focusing on Unity to create a small AR project, not only to create an augmented reality, but to immerse real world objects into the AR and XR devices.

Today, we will focus on building this experience

XR = Extended Reality
it is an umbrella term that encapsulates every concept of digitalized reality. It encompasses AR, VR, MR, etc.

AR history: this technology was being pioneered in the 1960s. To this day, the gamma is so extended, many different AR and VR devices exists. This technology has various ways of implementation, from handheld devices to larger hardware. Today, we will focus on utilizing headwear VR. Mixed reality is the sort of in between, where we incorporate the AR along with real obkjects. SO instead of haaving your view opacqued by a black blurred BG, you implement real images along with the virtually generated images. MR inclue see through headsets and spectacles. The quality of product include the functionality of image generation from AR and VR to be placed in everyday eyeglasses and sunglasses. 

There are great benefits and case uses to having this technology: aside from filmmaking and entertainment, we can use this technology for educational and training puirposes, as well for psychological intervention, product and technology engineering, marketing and factory spacing and production line

Even with the growth of VR< AR and XR, we still do not have the big revolutionary XR device tat can allow us to re-shape the technological future. The main competitors as of now remain the same: Meta, Google.
