This will be the first documented brainstorm product of our Final Project

All ideas written will be based on everything that has been discussed as a team and all things that we 
wish to implement as our MVP(minimum viable product). So far, the bigger picture of the first
version of our project has been to implement a web app that behaves like a personal trainer.
