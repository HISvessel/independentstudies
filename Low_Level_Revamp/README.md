This repository is our re introduction into low level programming, catered particularly towards learning our language of choice for advanced system's development, enormous side projects and enterprise quality code. That language is of course C++. We will divide this in levels and in languages, as it would be favorable if we could integrate other low level programming languages throughout our programming jouirney until God comes back for me. Stay tuned.
