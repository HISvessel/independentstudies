This repository bis our introduction and tutorial session for our final project at Holberton School: the future AI personal trainer. To implement the first version of this, first we will work with OpenCV and MediaPipe. The first goal is to leave no doubt as to whether this project can be attained in a span of 3 months of hard work. In order to integrate the usage of a camera as a tool to collect movement data input by the test subject, we must first determine that it is possible to get the camera to open and have the pose estimation sticks to work.
