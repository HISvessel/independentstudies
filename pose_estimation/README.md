This repository bis our introduction and tutorial session for our final project at Holberton School: the future AI personal trainer. To implement the first version of this, first we will work with OpenCV and MediaPipe. The first goal is to leave no doubt as to whether this project can be attained in a span of 3 months of hard work. In order to integrate the usage of a camera as a tool to collect movement data input by the test subject, we must first determine that it is possible to get the camera to open and have the pose estimation sticks to work. 

Questions to ask for our minimum viable product:
    1) Should form checking be the same for everyone or different?
    2) How can we take into account different human anatomy?
    3) Are body differences worth taking into consideration, or should we create a single model for everyone to follow?
    4) How can we scale up and scale down to a person's physical capacity?
    5) How many exercises can I model in a span of 3 months?
    > I should be able to have a minimalistic fullbody workout, at least(try to go for at least 3 compound lifts and at least 1 isolated or smaller lift to complement the big three: push ups, pullups, squats. This will be primarily calisthenics, no weightlifting as of yet.)
    6)
