"""this code snippet is our introduction into mediapipe: a 
cross platform framework designed to building perceptual pipelines, 
good for tasks like pose estimation, face landmarking, object tracking, 
etc. 

In our future project, this framework will detect human body keypoints
as the foundation for form analysis."""
