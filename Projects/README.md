This repository was created for the purpose of storing all of the projects done in independent studies. As mentioned earlier, the root directory that contains this relative directory intends to pave the way for Machine Learning and all components that will become relevant down the beaten path. These are some of the projects we will work on based on our learning phase: 


2️⃣ Hands-On Mini Projects (for Each Phase)
📍 Phase 1 – Foundational Programming
Banking App CLI – Track deposits/withdrawals (Python + file storage).

Text File Search Tool – Build a mini grep in Python.

Guess the Number Game – With random number generation and hints.

📍 Phase 2 – Data Analysis
Sales Data Dashboard – Use Pandas to process CSV sales data, Matplotlib to plot.

COVID-19 Data Tracker – Fetch API data, clean it, and visualize trends.

Movie Ratings Analyzer – Load datasets like MovieLens, run basic stats.

📍 Phase 3 – ML & Neural Networks
House Price Predictor – Train regression models on Kaggle’s housing dataset.

Spam Email Classifier – Train Naive Bayes classifier on email dataset.

Handwritten Digit Recognition – Build & train an MNIST neural network.

📍 Phase 4 – Data Engineering
ETL Pipeline – Pull data from an API, transform it, store it in a database.

Real-Time Tweet Stream – Use Tweepy + Kafka to stream tweets.

Data Warehouse Loader – Build a pipeline to load structured data into PostgreSQL.

Each project will have its own subdirectory.
