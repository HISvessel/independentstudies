This repository intends to tbe the first step towards the beginnig of dominion of data structures and algorithms for comprehending machine learning and projecting for our future roles as a full stack developer. Data structures is the type of data and methods utilized in programming for organizing data in continguous memory for instance. Some of the most common data structures to be utiized is arrays, or lists in python.

Knowing when and how to apply algorithms require good knowledge of the languagem the criteria and better learning prblem solving. This concept is loosely called algorithmic thinking. This form of thinking is a concept that comes up frequently in big tech's technical interviews. So, understanding this is the good pathway towards a solid job, but also this paves way for the fulfillment of our big goals.
