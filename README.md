This is a new repository created for the purpose of exapnding my programming knowledge in an independent way, meant to expand and explore concepts that will pave way towards making a full stack developer.

The purpose of this repository is to learn in an independent way various other programming languages, frameworks, modules and imports, as well as other programming methods. To this day, i can understand the concept of procedural languages and object oriented programming languages. I still have not fully learned the nuances of functional progamming, but this is a topic well inside the scope of my desired capacities.

The list, as it is now, will contain the following expansions:

Python's JAX module(machine learning)
Scala functional patterns and programming

As more concepts are presented and other desires are met, the list will continue to expand. Stay sharp.
