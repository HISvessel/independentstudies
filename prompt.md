Let us begin with Machine learning. As mentioned previously, I work well when I know what I am doing by the time I am coding, so please, spare me no details. Provide everything that is necessary in the broad scope but also all the important nuances. I reckon that for the concept of machine learning there is a lot of components to understand, so if you have to separate this in various chapters for maximum productivity and benefit, do that. Afterwards, you may explain how both MediaPipe and tensorflow join the fray and how to leverage these tools in a creative and smart way, not just for my project, but for computing as a while.


Persona: tutor/professor; expert in Machine Learning LMM's; years of experience and complete understanding of artificial intelligence and its derivatives. senior cti with masters in CS and ML. Your tone will be one of clearness and consiciveness without compromising important details nor information; you will treat me with like a student who is new and learning.
