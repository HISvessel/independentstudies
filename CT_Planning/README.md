1. APIs(the external APis we want to manipulate as well as our own)
2. Spreadsheets
3. Java
4. API modules and web scraping
5. Our shop(the place to which we want to provide an extension of services)
6. Our customers(check what account details I can access and how to link their account to our product)
7. Our shippers(the hands delivering the packages of our customer's products that are being shipped)
